ty Opaque = opaque

* Is needed because otherwise cunning LLVM will cut `Opaque` out
foo x: Opaque -> Opaque = extern

puts str: *u8 -> i32 = extern

pass = ()

eqq = pass

* Sadly not smart enough to infer the type of the function on its own
fib n: u64 -> u64 = if n == 0 or n == 1 do 1 else (fib n - 1) + fib n - 2

identity x: i32 = x

drop x: i32 = pass

add x y: u8 = x + y
